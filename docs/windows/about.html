    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      From a young age, I’ve been fascinated with how technology works. 
      I began programming in high school, which quickly led me into deeper studies of 
      <strong>AI, cybersecurity, and low-level system development</strong>. 
      I love working on projects that blend creativity and logic — from 
      emulating old-school operating systems to building machine learning models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring the outdoors in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, 
      reading about computer history, and automating everyday tasks for fun.
